## About
This project contains the implementation of a fully connected multi-layer neural network using only python and numpy.

## Files

#### ANN.py
This file contain the class ANN in which is stored the whole logic of the neural network.

#### main.py
In this file I test the ANN class using the mnist dataset.
Preprocessing the data and using a fully connected neural network with one hidden layer made of 150 neurons trained for 3 epochs I reach an accuracy of 0.96.

## Prerequisites
To use the ANN you need a machine with Python and the numpy library. To run the test in main.py you also need keras to get the databse. I am using:
-   Python 3.10.9
-   Numpy 1.21.6
-   Keras 2.11.0
